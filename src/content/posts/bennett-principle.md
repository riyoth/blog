In Digital Minimalism, [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/) covers the Bennett principle as a way to live a more fulfilling life.

The Bennett principle: We should dedicate our leisure time to challenging activities: they are more engaging, rewarding, and don't tire as much as you'd think.

Lesson 1: Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption.
Lesson 2: Use skill to produce valuable things in the physical world.
Lesson 3: Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interaction

In practice, this principle could take the following form in your life:
- fix or build something every week
- Join something
- Schedule your low-quality leisure
