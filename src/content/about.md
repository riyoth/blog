I’m a software developer with a strong background in DevOps,  networking, and cloud computing. I love solving real problems for real people. In the past, I’ve used Python, Django, and Flask to build small and large web applications. Tooling for the development team is a particular interest of mine. Ensuring fast feedback, rapid deployment, and rollback is the best way to deliver great software.

I’ve started this blog to write about my project and experimentation. I will cover my work at [DreamHack Canada](http://dreamhack.ca), [CS Games](https://csgames.org) and other personal projects.
